# Review Data Preprocessing and Analysis

This project involves preprocessing and analyzing textual review data. The primary goal is to clean, normalize, and convert the data into numerical vectors for further analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Steps in Preprocessing

### 1. **Loading Data**
The dataset is sourced from a GitHub repository and loaded into the environment for processing.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were removed or imputed to ensure a clean dataset.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate rows were identified and removed to avoid redundancy.
- **Eliminating Irrelevant Entries**: Irrelevant rows or columns that did not contribute to the analysis were dropped.

### 3. **Text Normalization**
- Converted all text to lowercase.
- Removed punctuation, special characters, and numbers to retain meaningful words.

### 4. **Tokenization**
- Split reviews into individual words for better processing and analysis.
- Removed stopwords to focus on significant terms.

### 5. **Stemming and Lemmatization**
- Applied stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms, ensuring uniformity in the dataset.

### 6. **Feature Representation**
The text data was converted into numerical vectors for machine learning:
- **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: A simple method capturing word frequency.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Weighed word importance relative to the corpus.
- **Embeddings**: Dense representations capturing semantic relationships between words using pre-trained models like GloVe.

## Dataset Export
The preprocessed dataset was saved into a CSV file for future use in machine learning and analytical tasks.

## Key Learnings and Recommendations
- **Method Selection**: TF-IDF or Word Embeddings are recommended for nuanced tasks like sentiment analysis or context understanding.
- **Scalability**: Preprocessing steps like tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization significantly improve dataset quality and model performance.
