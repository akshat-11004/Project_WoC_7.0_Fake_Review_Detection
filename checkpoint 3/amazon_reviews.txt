The KVIDIO Updated Bluetooth Headphones are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for quality over-ear wireless headphones. The sound quality is exceptional, with crisp highs and deep bass that enhance the listening experience for music, calls, and even audiobooks. The 65-hour battery life is impressive and lives up to its promise, making these headphones ideal for long trips or extended use without constant recharging.Comfort is another standout featureâ€”the ear cushions are soft and fit snugly without causing discomfort, even during hours of wear. The Bluetooth connection is stable and pairs seamlessly with multiple devices, adding to the overall convenience.One area that could be improved is the build quality of the frame. While lightweight, it feels slightly less sturdy than expected, which might raise durability concerns over time. A more robust design would make these headphones perfect in every way.Overall, these headphones are an excellent value for the price and deliver a premium experience with just a bit of room for enhancement. Highly recommended!

I decided back in the Spring to make the switch from earbuds to head phones since the latter has been proven to be much better for your hearing. Now in December I decided to write a review and hype these up to make sure the gang at KVIDIO gets their bag. I love these headphones so much that I purchased two more pairs for my mom and girlfriend who are also both obsessed.The sound quality is very good, especially at this price point, but the real differentiator here is the battery life. These things are eternal when it comes to battery and dwarf the battery life of every other pair headphones, gaming headset, and earbuds I have ever used. They last me almost two weeks of daily listening and fully recharge in an hour and change. The battery is so good that its strange. I also have had good experiences with the microphone and have never ran into issues with pairing.As others have noted, they are rather flimsy, but this has not been a problem for me, my girlfriend, or my mom (and my mom and I can be rather clumsy lol). Though you could easily break these at the folding points if you were overly reckless . I also think its important to call out that these are NOT noise cancelling, so if you want NC look elsewhere. I use these primarily for running outside and working out at the gym, and you can hear weights hitting the floor around you. That being said, I still consider them to have decent NC for headphones not advertising as having such.Basically, if you aren't too concerned about NC, these are a must-buy at this price point.

Pros: Light weight, comfortable, decent sound, low price. connects to 2 devices at the same time, Battery life is long. Cons: not tight fitting. Ive heard better low and high end headphones. Overall great buy for everyday, wont break the wallet if it breaks, comfortable, some headphones are heavy and tight causing me to feel fatigue from wearing them. These are pretty good.

With a coupon, it cost $18. Money well spent. I do have ear buds, but I hate how those would get loose, and the bass would drop off.  This KVIDIO headphone comfortably stays in place, even when I'm at the gym, ensuring consistent sound quality, especially the bass. Bluetooth makes this more pleasant to use, no more dealing with a cord when I'm on the go. When paired to your phone, this also works well when taking calls. And the battery life, WOW! I've been using this for a week now, and the battery level is still at 100%.While these sound good, my Audio Technica ATH-M50x sound better. But I'm not going to use my ATHH-M50x in the gym (too nice to sweat on, cord). Point is, don't expect audiophile sound from KVIDIO. Be like me, be happy with its decent sound, convenience of Bluetooth and awesome battery life.

After having a couple pairs of walmart cheap headphones it's nice to have have a quality pair again. They are comfortable and sound quality is good. Easy quick charging and the amount I use them, which is several hours a day, they last 3-4 days before needing to be charged. Immediately compatible with my MacBook Pro.

After a bloated phone battery incident which was fixed, I sadly discovered the earpiece to my phone was damaged by the repair person and found only the speaker phone mode was working. (I was on holiday and couldn't return to the repair shop to have them fix it.) I needed an alternative rather than shelling out for yet another repair or replacement.I have very small ears, earbuds do not fit me and the bluetooths that hang off the ears I always found I had to press them against my head to hear anything. Making me look more like a secret service agent rather than a person just talking with their sister.I am on a limited income (disability), I came across KVIDIO and decided to take the chance. The price was within my budget and read the specs that was aligned with what I needed. I am so far very happy with my purchase.They are light weight, fit snugly against the ears without pressure. The ear cups are very soft and high quality. I wear glasses and I do not have any pain from the temple arms being pressed into the head as I do with other earphones. Outside noise is minimal. The battery life is quite long and the range is great for hands free in a bachlor apartment.  Phone calls are in stereo. I have not yet used them to listen to music, so I cannot comment on the virtues or detriments of that option.Pairing the earphones with devices is very easy, just a press of a button. My only caveat is the USB cord for charging. It is very short, about 6 inches in length. I use a C-Clamp near my USB hub and hang them off of there for a quick charge and easy access for when a call comes through.All in all they are:  Comfortable, Very Light Weight, Well Made (sturdy & seems long lasting) and very easy to use. Comes with instruction booklet in mutliple languages, plus their website has further information. I would definately recommend.
